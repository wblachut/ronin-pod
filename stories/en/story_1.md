## Marshes

### The Road into the Marshes

To reach the next village, you must cross the mountains. But a landslide has buried the only pass.
Locals tell you there is another way — through the marshes.
A grand manor rises nearby, surrounded by fields of carved stone tombs ornamented with gold. Within lives a noble family known for their wealth. The young Lord greets you with courtesy, though his voice carries sadness.
He tells you that the passage across the marshes is not safe anymore, travelers vanish there. He asks you to uncover the cause.
That night, while preparing your boat by the misted shore, faint Hitodama drift above the water — pale, flickering lights like souls searching for rest. They seem like inviting you to follow them

You must decide: follow the ghostly lights now, or wait for dawn and wait for appointed local guide.

#### ♣ Choice 1 — Exploration vs Diplomacy

<details>
<summary>🔍 Exploration</summary>

You push from the shore, following the lights deeper into the wetlands. The air grows heavy with the scent of decay. The Hitodama hover close, forming a path between drowned trees.
The marsh seems to breathe — aware of your presence. When the lights fade, you find yourself surrounded by silence thick as fog.

<summary>🤝 Diplomacy</summary>

You remain until morning, speaking with villagers and monks. They speak of the late Lord — a man so wealthy that even his tombs gleam with gold. They say he feared death, hoarding treasures and refusing to part with them.
At dawn, you depart with Ping, a quiet guide who keeps his eyes fixed ahead and never on the water.

Hours later, reeds close in around your boat. The water turns black and still.
Then — movement. From beneath the surface, tiger-like Suiko surge upward, claws slashing and teeth flashing.

#### ♣ Choice 2 — Sword vs Magic

<details>
<summary>🗡 Sword</summary>

You draw steel and strike. The fight is fierce, the marsh exploding with mud and blood. One Suiko wounds you deeply before vanishing below.
Following faint Hitodama, you reach a half-sunken hut — its roof caved, its walls rotting.
Inside, torn silks and broken ornaments scatter the floor. A golden hairpin, fine as a sunbeam, gleams in the mud. You bind your wound with the silk and rest among the ruins.

<summary>✨ Magic</summary>

You raise your hand. Energy bursts from your palm — raw, blinding, enough to drive the Suiko back. But the surge shatters your boat, splintering wood across the dark water.
You swim to shore and plan to craft a new raft. As you work, you discover an item on the grass - a book, you grab it the marsh grows silent. The stillness feels like attention — as though something unseen watches your every motion.

Hours pass before thunder rolls above you.
Stormlight flickers across the water — a sign to move on.
The Hitodama gather ahead, glowing brighter in the rain, swirling like a silent call.
From the mist emerges a wraith clad in tattered noble robes.
Its face is a hollow echo, its chest hollowed where a heart might have been.
Around its neck hangs an amulet, black and gleaming, pulsing faintly with power. The crest stitched into its cloak bears the same sigil as the young Lord’s family.

Speak or react with the magical power, what will you do?

You examine the amulet closely, seeing its faint reflection in the hairpin’s sheen — two lives bound not by spell, but sorrow.
You hold them close together. Light spills forth — warm, not burning.
The wraith trembles and fades, its voice a whisper swallowed by thunder.

🗡 Sword Dominant:
You realize the truth: the amulet is not a curse, but a cage — forged by the Lord’s own attachment to his treasures. You raise your blade.
The strike splits the crystal. The spirit screams, not in anger but release, dissolving into the rain. The sound echoes across the marsh, carried like a sigh of ending greed.

### Ending

<details>
<summary>Epilogue</summary>
When the storm clears, the marsh feels lighter — the fog thinner, the water calm.
You return to the manor by dawn. The young Lord receives you, pale and shaken.

When you describe him the hairpin, his expression breaks.
He recognizes it — his mother’s. She died young, and his father never recovered.

The old Lord’s wealth, his obsession, his grief — all tied him to this world.
He says nothing more, only nods, eyes hollow with fear and understanding.
Before you depart, he presses a sealed parchment into your hand — a guide through the marshes and a letter of passage to the next province.
You leave him standing in the doorway, staring into the morning fog that swallows the ruins of his fathers pride.
