# Ronin - Path of Destiny

## Fire and Ice 🌋

### Fiery Moonflower ( _for the first player_ )

Fate has driven you into a karst cave in a beautiful region. In the darkness, you see a flickering glow — a Fiery Moonflower, a rare, luminescent flower that is an incredibly prized alchemical ingredient. As you approach to pick it, you see a body lying by the flower — an old seeker, perhaps a mage. On their hand rests a beautiful bracelet with an animal: is it a dog? Maybe a fox? Perhaps a Shiba?. You pick it up carefully, feeling a slight tingling as you slip it onto your wrist.

### Years Later ( _everyone_ )

You stand at the base of a majestic volcano, the village below is in flames. From the magma crevices emerge fire creatures - chaos and energy, hurling themselves at the villagers. You must do something!

#### ♣ Choice 1 — Magic vs Diplomacy ( _Result for the first player's character, everyone votes_ )

Do you want to stop the creatures with magic or… command?

<details>
<summary>✨ Magic</summary>
You raise your hand as if casting a spell. You feel the bracelet pulse — found long ago in the cave — the beings stop and cease their attack, staring at you with curiosity. You feel a strange bond with them, as if they understood your thoughts.

...

</details>

<details>
<summary>🤝 Diplomacy</summary>

You try to speak to the elementals. To your companions' surprise, they respond to your words. They look at you, asking what you said and in what language — you yourself aren't sure what happened, but you know you managed to halt the attack.

</details>

<details>
<summary> 🔶 Continuation </summary>

The villagers thank you for the rescue, and in their eyes you see both gratitude and respect. An old man observes you carefully; you approach him to ask if he knows You. He tells you the story of four bracelets that allow communication with creatures from four elemental planes. He asks if you possess the fox bracelet and tells you about the three others. He suggests that with the bracelet's help, you could discover why the fire creatures attacked the village. You agree with him.

After resting and a brief journey, you stand before a volcanic cave, with hot magma flowing down the side of a narrow path. Your companions feel the scorching heat, while you feel only pleasant warmth. The fire creatures are clearly agitated, frightened, and distrustful. When you approach and communicate with them, they calm down. They trust you — after all, you speak their language. They explain why they ended up in the village: they didn't want to attack humans, but lost part of their territory and ended up there by accident, which led to misunderstanding — they attacked out of fear when the villagers raised an alarm. They tell you about problems with water elementals expansion — more and more snow and ice creatures appear on the volcano's slopes, clashes with them are increasingly frequent, and fire beings are being pushed deeper into volcanic caves. They ask for your help.

</details>

#### ♣ Choice 2 — Fight vs Exploration

Will you draw your sword in their defense, or will you first try to discover why there are so many water creatures?

<details>
<summary>🗡 Fight</summary>

You promise to help them. Climbing the slopes, you immediately notice the enormity of the problem — ice elementals are in overwhelming numbers. Additionally falling snow limits the visibility. Every move requires great effort. Combat exhausts you quickly. It becomes clear that the balance between elements has been seriously disrupted, and your effort is merely a drop in the ocean. You retreat with difficulty. You return to the village and tell the old man everything.

...

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔍 Exploration</summary>

You set out to explore. First, you climb higher, observing the snowy and icy fields in the mountains. On your return, you observe the area, noticing unusual mist vortexes and strange weather anomalies. After returning to the village, you examine scrolls kept by the old man and speak with him about the eternal balance of elements. Everything points to a disturbance in harmony.

</details>

<details>
<summary> 🔶 Continuation </summary>

The elder guides you to the conclusion that weather is responsible for everything. But it is controlled by ocean currents flowing from the south, so answers must be sought there. You set out on a journey.

During a long voyage, sailors tell you that flying fish in the area — previously rare — have recently become quite common, now abundant with many new species. They also mention problems with cod, which increasingly migrates north, disrupting traditional fishing and introducing uncertainty for local fishermen.

You finally reach an island whose economy has flourished thanks to fishing and the export of parrot fish and butterfly fish. The inhabitants reveal that they owe everything to a mage who changes winds and weather so that schools of exotic fish reach local fishermen's hands — through this he can earn a fortune, because these species now appear only in this region and are commonly treated as rarities.

During conversation with the inhabitants, you spot a person in a robes observing you from the shadows. He hold a staff with three perpendicular disks — the middle one appears to be made from a bracelet similar to the one you possess. He seem concerned by your presence and appear to be about to cast a spell.

#### ♣ Choice 3 — Fight vs Diplomacy

Do you draw your sword and act quickly, or do you attempt to handle this diplomatically?

<details>
<summary>🗡 Fight</summary>

You draw your sword, ready for the confrontation.

You are faster than him — the mage raises his hands and explains that he did nothing wrong, and his actions are meteorological in nature, not combat related.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🗡 → ✨ Magic dominant:</summary>

The mage quickly taps his staff on the ground and summons dens mists. You cannot see anything only hear his voice. He asks why you disturb him and demands an answer.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🤝 → ✨ Magic dominant:</summary>

The mage casts a translation spell — he reveals that he is not from here and wants to know why you disturb him.

### Ending

<details>
<summary> 🟧 Epilogue</summary>
After informing the mage about the situation with the volcano and the battle between fire and water elements, he agrees to join you on a journey. He wants to investigate what climate changes he caused, and if he discovers they caused harm, he promises to reverse the introduction of the warm ocean current. You prepare for a joint return expedition.
